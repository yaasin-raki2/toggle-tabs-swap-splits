# Toggle Tabs - Swap Splits

A JetBrains IDE plugin for **per-split tab history navigation**.

## Features

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **XToggle** | Alternates between back and forward navigation |
| **XBack** | Navigate backward in current split's history |
| **XForward** | Navigate forward in current split's history |
| **XSwap** | Swap current tab between split panes |

## Why?

The built-in IDE back/forward navigation is global - it jumps across all splits. This plugin tracks history **per split pane**, making navigation predictable when working with multiple files side-by-side.

## Setup
